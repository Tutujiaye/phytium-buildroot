2023.03.09 changed by Phytium team 
	We made some changes to buildroot to make it easier for Phytium users to build the system. 
	We added several defconfig files to the configs directory so that users can build busybox, ubuntu, and debian systems for the Phytium D2000 and E2000 development boards. 
	In order to support ubuntu and debian, we modified some skeleton-custom related files and created the board/phytium directory. 
	We made some changes in the linux directory to support linux-headers, which is used to compile kernel external modules. 
	We modified or added these packages in the package directory: busybox, ffmpeg, igh-ethercat, phytium-optee, rootfs-chown, vpu-lib, xorg-rogue-umlibs. 
	The external toolchain Arm AArch64 was downgraded from 2021.07 to 2020.11 in order to align the glibc version with the one in ubuntu20.04.
